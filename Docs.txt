//install mocha
//npm install mocha@3.0.0 --save-dev
//save dev means that this is only for dev purpose since testing => it wont be downloaded by hroku to cause any delay
//utils.test.js extension is used to tell mocha that this file will contain the tests
//tests are written using "it" and throw function - create your code in utils.js and write test for these in utils.test.js and run as below
//In package.json, scripts, test => write the script => "test": "mocha **/*.test.js"
//in terminal do, npm test which will run the script we just added i.e. run the tests

//Now lets see a way to run the tests continously as we make code changes using nodemon
//when the nodemon keeps server running like we did before, it actually keeps running the command to run the file => we can now use --exec to run any command in the world continously
//nodemon --exec 'npm test' =>

//now lets see how to create our custom script in json package
//"test-custom": "nodemon --exec 'npm test'"
//we can create any script in similar way.

//Now to start the script, you have to do this in terminal : npm run script_name => npm run test-custom


//Now we will learn to use assertions => see mjackson expect lubrary for that on github
//npm install expect@1.20.2 --save-dev
//now see the docs on github for all the methods => we wont be using simple if else, we will be using the assertions
//we start off by expect() method and passing the variable to be tested in it and then we chain the assertion methods from the docs
