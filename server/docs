supertest is lib for testing the express framework
visit the github repo of this for seeing the syntax


making test => pass the app object of the server to request, and what result you expect in expect and done can be called inside end and then the npm run test-custom
we can also give expect on status code : 200

supertest only supports equal assertion (by value) unlike expect library => to make all other assertions, we have to use expect library along with supertest => for this we can put a callback inside a supertest expect() which will be called and return us a response object and then inside this calback we can use expect lib to perform all the test on this response object

Next, we will learn about describe which is inside the mocha which helps us in organising the tests by grouping them together and reducing code.
So, we can group together some test under common name which make them searchable and orgnaised => For example in utils.test file, we first grouped all testsunder name 'utils ' and then we grouped all add related tests together => in express, we should group all get, post, etc test separately using describe and within get also, we can further group like : tests for /about, tests for /home...like this

in describe, to use it for method, we usaully give name starting with #...like #add => all test for add method
